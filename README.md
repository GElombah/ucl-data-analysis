# 🏆 UEFA Champions League (UCL) Data Analysis 📊

This project explores historical data from the **UEFA Champions League finals (1955–2023)** using Python. It includes interactive and static visualizations to uncover trends, top-performing teams, and attendance patterns across decades.

## 📁 Datasets Used
- `ucl_finals_1955_2023.csv`: Contains UCL final results, venues, attendance, and winners/runners-up.
- (Optional) `ucl_all_time_performance.csv`: Team performance across all UCL seasons.

## 💡 Key Analyses
- 🔝 **Top UCL Winners**: Who has won the most finals?
- 🥈 **Most Runner-Up Finishes**: Teams with the most near-misses.
- 🔥 **Top Finalists**: Teams with the most total final appearances.
- 👥 **Attendance Trends**: Exploring how final crowds have changed.
- 🏟️ **Most Frequent Venues**: Stadiums that hosted the UCL final the most.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
